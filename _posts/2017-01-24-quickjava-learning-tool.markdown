<p>QuickJava has been shared on github, so you can download and start to coding.</p>

<p>To run on a Linux host, you need Oracle JDK or Openjdk, bash terminal, make tools and a text editor (like nano or gedit) installed on your linux distro.</p>

<p>You can run QuickJava on Windows by Cygwin environment and notepad++ editor.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">INSTALLATION</h2>

<p>Once installed basic software (java compilers and make), you can install quick 
java following next istructions:</p>

<h3 class="section-heading"> 1) GNU/LINUX - UNIX:</h3>
     extract quickjava package to home directory

<p>1) Set JDK_PATH, JRE_PATH, JAR_PATH in conf/config.cfg.
       if have installed openjdk into your home then JDK_PATH=~/openjdk/bin/
       else leave empty these values if you have installed into default system path
       (in more linux distros you can install openjdk from a package manager)</p>

2) Run chmod update-env and run the script to configure:

<blockquote>
       user@hostname ~/quickjava $ chmod +x update-env

       user@hostname ~/quickjava $ ./update-env
       Created conf/global.cfg
       Created conf/make.hd
       Generating Makefile..OK
       Makefile found

       Everything should be ready to start now. </blockquote>




<h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
