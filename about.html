<p>Computer enthusiast since fourteen years old, I like unix-like systems (GNU/Linux and BSD), programming languages (Java and Python), Arduino, Raspberry & IoT devices. Graduated in Computer Science, I work as programmer and system administrator.</p>

<p>I'm a Tinker for hobby and Isaac Asimov's fan</p>
