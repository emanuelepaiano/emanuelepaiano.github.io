<p>Computer enthusiast since fourteen years old, I like unix-like systems (GNU/Linux and BSD), programming languages (Java and Python), Drones, Arduino, Raspberry & IoT devices. Graduated in Computer Science, I work as frontend and backend programmer (using framework Angular 6 + Spring).</p>

<p>I'm a Tinker and Isaac Asimov's fan</p>
